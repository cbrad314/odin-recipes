        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is my go-to method for grilling thick steaks -- 1.5" or thicker. Perfect this recipe, and you may never order a steak from one of those fancy restaurants again.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Ribeye steaks at least 1.5 inches thick. This normally serves 2 people.</li>
                <li>Kosher salt</li>
                <li>Coarsely ground black pepper</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <p><em>This assumes you like your steak medium rare. If you prefer yours another way, evaluate your life choices. If you are still being stubborn, look up beef temperature guides and adjust the temps below accordingly.</em></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Dry brine the steak with kosher salt about 4 hours before grilling. <em>Use 1/4 teaspoon of Kosher salt for each pound.</em></li>
            <li>Setup a clean grill for 2-zone cooking, with a target temp of 225 degrees on the indirect side.</li>
            <li>Add coarsely ground black pepper to taste, pressing it into the meat.</li>
            <li>Add meat to the indirect side of the grill and wait for the temp to reach around 110 degrees.</li>
            <li>Open the lid. Pat the meat dry and move it to direct flame. Watch the meat closely and keep it from being hit by flare-ups. </li>
            <li>We want a rich, brown crust on both sides. Gently flip the meet often to create the desired crust</li>
            <li>When the meat reaches 125 degrees, remove it and serve immediately!</li>
        </ol>
