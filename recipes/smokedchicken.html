        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is my go-to method for grilling thick, steakhouse cheeseburgers -- 1." or thicker. </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>10 oz of Ground Chuck per burger</li>
                <li>Kosher salt</li>
                <li>Coarsely ground black pepper. Other seasonings (paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, chili powder) are optional.</li>
                <li>Cheese of your choice (American, Cheddar, Pepperjack, Swiss, Blue Cheese, Boursin)</li>
                <li>Brioche, Pretzel, or your other preferred bun</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Loosely form the burgers into 1-1.5 inch thick patties.</li>
            <li>Dry brine the burgers with kosher salt about 2 hours before grilling. <em>Use 1/4 teaspoon of Kosher salt for each pound.</em></li>
            <li>Setup a clean grill for 2-zone cooking, with a target temp of 225 degrees on the indirect side.</li>
            <li>Add coarsely ground black pepper to taste.</li>
            <li>Add meat to the indirect side of the grill and wait for the temp to reach around 130 degrees.</li>
            <li>Open the lid. Pat the meat dry and move it to direct flame. Watch the meat closely and keep it from being hit by flare-ups. </li>
            <li>We want a rich, brown crust on both sides. Gently flip the meet often to create the desired crust. You can also toast the buns at this time.</li>
            <li>When the meat reaches 140 degrees (135 for slower melting cheeses like Boursin and Blue Cheese), move the burget back to the indirect side of the grill and add the cheese.</li>
            <li>Once the cheese is melted and the meat is around 145, remove the cheesburger, place it on the bun and serve immediately!</li>
        </ol>
