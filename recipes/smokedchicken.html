        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is my go-to method for smoking a whole chicken. </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 whole chicken, cut up</li>
                <li>Kosher salt</li>
                <li>Coarsely ground black pepper. Other seasonings (paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, chili powder) are optional.</li>
                <li>Wood Chunks or chipped for smoking</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut up the chicken, removing innards and backbone. You should have 2 of each part -- breast, thigh, wings, and legs.</li>
            <li>Dry brine the chicken with kosher salt about 2-4 hours before cooking.
            <li>Setup a clean grill for 2-zone cooking, with a target temp of 275 degrees on the indirect side.</li>
            <li>Add seasonings to taste.</li>
            <li>Add wood chunks to the grill. About 1 or 2 ounces should be sufficient. Chicken will easily take on the smoky flavors, so less is more in this case.</li>
            <li>Add meat to the indirect side of the grill, skin side up, and wait for the temp to reach around 160 degrees. This normally takes 1-2 hours</li>
            <li>Open the lid and move the chicken to direct flame. We want to make a nice crust on the skin here and bring the temp up to 165 degrees.</li>

            <li>Once the meat is reaches 165 and the skin has a nice crust, remove the chicken  and serve immediately!</li>
        </ol>
